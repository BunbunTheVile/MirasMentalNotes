  "Content": "Le Souterrain - the Undercity of Pont d\u0027Amiti\u00E9 - are the underground parts of an ancient second era city on top of which Pont d\u0027Amiti\u00E9 was (unknowingly) built. It largely intersects with the borders of Pont d\u0027Amiti\u00E9 on the city\u0027s Eastern side. The Souterrain\u0027s Eastern outskirts reach further than Pont d\u0027Amiti\u00E9s official borders, into the adjacent swamp land.\n\nMost of the Undercity lies up to a hundred metres underground. It is nevertheless structured exactly like a surface city, with no structural support for the caves\u0027 ceiling and vast open plazas, suggesting that it was buried during or after the Great Calamity. The original city\u0027s history is still almost entirely unknown, but it is slowly being excavated by the increasing populace of the Souterrain, giving a number of brave archeologist\u0027s the opportunity to study the mysterious ruins.\n\nThe Souterrain is an entirely lawless place, separated from the surface city. Most people there live by a code of absolute freedom, meaning that everyone is free to act in whatever way they please, as long as they can handle the consequences. This has led to a society in which the strength of an individual to protect themselves has become a key requirement for basic survival.\n\nFor centuries it has served as a refuge for the poor and the less morally inclined Marisian and Ravnian populace of Pont d\u0027Amiti\u00E9, but it was only after the Glorious Rebellion that it was transformed into something akin to a city. This is due to a number of influential gangs laying claim to vast stretches of the Undercity\u0027s territory, growing their power and allowing them to broker secret agreements with the surface city\u0027s government to stay out of each other\u0027s way. These agreements are the foundation of the complete lawlessness of the Undercity, as even the killing of the rich and noble will never result in any substantial consequences.\n\nMost of the greater gangs, like the Rats des Marais, the Loups de l\u0027Enfer, or les Pensifs have recognized the value that can be \u0022civilly\u0022 extracted from those up above. For a substantial fee, the citizens of Pont d\u0027Amiti\u00E9 - often simply referred to as les Poulettes (the chickens) - are allowed to enter a gang\u0027s territory under their protection. This has led to parts of the Souterrain becoming veritable tourist attractions, luring in the wealthy \u0022chickens\u0022 with promises of illegal drugs, violent entertainment, and other similar vices.\n\n",
