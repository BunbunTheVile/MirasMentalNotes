  "Content": "Ivan Ozerov - also known by his self-given name \u0022Ivan the Magnificent\u0022 - is a mercenary leader hailing from Port Alexander. With his piercing green eyes and luscious golden mane, Ivan presents himself as a knight in shining armour and a saviour of the people. He originally earned a living in quite a cowardly fashion. Through his charm and seeming confidence, he amassed a large group of mercenaries under his command - calling them his Shining Brigade, who then did most of the actual mercenary work for him.\n\nAlthough a coward at first, Ivan found himself inspired by a group of adventurers during D\u00FBr\u0027Randir\u0027s attacks on the island of Ch\u00FB. Not much later, he travelled to the church of Ma\u0027i in Port Karina, dedicating himself and his brigade to the goddess of light. Now an actual paladin of Ma\u0027i, Ivan has begun travelling the continent with his brigade to aid those in need wherever he can.",
