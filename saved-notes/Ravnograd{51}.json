  "Content": "Ravnograd is the capital city of Ravanov and is one of the largest Mayterran cities with a population of roughly 120000 people. Much of it is influenced by the Ravnian arcane tradition, as can be seen in a great number of magic tinkerer\u0027s shops, libraries, and wizards all across the city. Any mage affiliated with Ravanov holds great respect in this city. It is the country\u0027s administrative centre, housing the Ravnian royal family and most governmental bodies, such as the Velikiy Sovet Gertsogov - the Grand Council of Dukes.\n\nWhile Khranov remains the country\u0027s main military centre, the arcane branch of the Ravnian military has its headquarters in Ravnograd. Furthermore, the Royal Academy of the Arcane of Ravnograd trains the Ravnian Artilleriya, including both Arkaniya and Blistatya. Its head is Queen Karina II, although much of the actual administrative work is delegated to academy\u0027s archmage. The current archmage is Mariya Shlykova Ivanovna, more commonly known among the populace as the \u0022Lady of Storms\u0022.\n\nOne of the city\u0027s most famous sights are the three Obsidian Mirrors, positioned at each of Ravnograd\u0027s main gates. These might just be the continent\u0027s only freely accessible teleportation gates. There is no fee for transcribing the gates\u0027 sigil signature and any mage registered at the Ravnian Royal Academy is free to use them as they please.\n\n",
