  "Content": "In 2415 the two gnome siblings Nika and Warwin Applesweet have found a way to bind the souls of dying people to humanoid, doll-like automata. Keeping the true nature of the dolls\u0027 sentience a secret, Nika and Warwin have managed to sell a good number of meticulously designed and decorated dolls to the richest members of Dalish high society. Using an incredibly complex mesh of programmable arcane fibers, the dolls\u0027 free will can be thoroughly restricted and controlled, making them the perfect servants.\n\nEasily the most famous doll is Bj\u00F8rn the Skald, a musical virtuoso able to play even the most exotic instruments in his master\u0027s posession. He is owned by the timber magnate Klopine Quickbranch. Bj\u00F8rn\u0027s original identity was the highly respected bard and adventurer Lohgrin of the Strings, who just so happened to disappear roughly two years ago.",
