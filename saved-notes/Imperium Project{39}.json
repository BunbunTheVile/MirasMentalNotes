  "Content": "The Imperium Project (Imperium meaning \u0022Supremacy\u0022 in this context) was an experimental undertaking by the Holy Alliance during the later parts of the War of the End Times that led up to the Great Calamity. The forces of Meyram and Solfrik were seeking the means to destroy Rott for good, initiating a monumental project whose main research site was located near modern Pont d\u0027Amiti\u00E9. Due to the sheer size of the operation, thousands of people settled around the site, building what is now known as the Souterrain of Pont d\u0027Amiti\u00E9. The actual history of the Souterrain or the Imperium Project are however not yet known by anyone.\n\nMost of the research focused on scientifically discerning the true nature of the divine - what it was, where it originates, and how one can manipulate it. The idea was that a thorough enough understanding of divinity would allow both the destruction of divine beings, as well as the artificial creation of a new heavenly army.\n\nOf the weapons developed to destroy Rott, Meyram\u0027s Star was the first working prototype - a weapon capable of banishing all of a minor deity\u0027s essence from this plane of existence. Its foundation is the Essential Theory of Divinity that was developed as part of the project.\n\nThe research site was often simply referred to as the Platinum Compound due to its silvery, metallic outer shell. It hosted both a secret military base as well as numerous laboratories and crafting workshops.",
