  "Content": "Saint Linn of the Western Isles is one of Null\u0027s earliest disciples, having experienced Null\u0027s emergence during the Void Century as an aspect of Solfrik. Although she has served Them for over 2000 years at this point, her story as well as her abilities remain largely unknown. She does however appear to hold significant power over the souls of mortals, being able to guide those she deems worthy, in life as in death. \n\nOne must assume that Linn deliberately keeps her status and history a secret, as she lives in an unassuming small chapel in Port Karina, being known to most simply as \u0022the old hag in the slums\u0022. Despite her abilities, she has indeed chosen to remain in her original gnoll body. Her physical form is incredibly weak and frail. She also appears to be blind in both eyes, relying on other means to perceive her surroundings.",
