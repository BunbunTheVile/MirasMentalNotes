A stunning number of Orcs, Chuuls, Kuo-Toa and Merrow in the West have noticed his return and have been given a chance to redeem themselves for their inactivity over the past months. The city of Port Karina is now under siege by a horde of vile monsters of the sea. And worst of all, D\u00FBr\u0027Randir has given the Orcish priests instructions on unleashing a new vicious form of Grey Ones.\n\nThe siege must be stopped, and the Grey Ones must be prevented from multiplying before their presence cascades into an unstoppable horde of undead.",
