  "Content": "2376: Heinrich von Martell signs a contract with archdevil Fierna, granting him incredible physical power as well as a potent magical charm\n\n2415: Heinrich re-negotiates his contract: His soull will be freed and he can keep his powers if he manages to secure 50.000 souls for Fierna. He is granted the privilege to form contracts through his advisor Meluna - one of Fierna\u0027s higher subordinates. Meluna also poses as Heinrich\u0027s wife.\n\n2416, Equin: Heinrich is pressured by Fierna to work faster. He devises the Forsaken Prisoners scheme. Prisoners of War can freely sign contracts with Meluna to secure their escape.

Heinrich orders the immediate execution of the invasion with all the troops that are already prepared.",
