  "Content": "Rina Shiodori is a young rogue samurai from Hiyakari. While originally serving the Hiyakari military as a high-ranking bodyguard, Rina has been expelled and sentenced to death after failing to protect the officer she was assigned to. In a fit of panic, Rina fled her home country across the Veroxian ocean, barely surviving the journey and washing up on the coast of Ch\u00FB during D\u00FBr\u0027Randir\u0027s attacks on the island. There, she bravely took up arms against the forces of the Grey Wanderer.\n\nRina now seeks to regain her honour in whatever way she can, helping whoever she meets along her travels, readily risking her own life for even the poorest and most desperate. She has yet to refuse a plea for help. She is currently travelling ever further East after interpreting one of her dreams as a sign that her honour can be regained somewhere in that direction. However, her actual destination remains unclear.",
