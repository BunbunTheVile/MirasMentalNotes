  "Content": "Dead Zones are those places of Trivandir that have yet to recover from the aftermath of the Great Calamity. They are characterized by a thick, hazy miasma that destroys, transforms, corrupts or erases anything inside of it. Given the fragility of living beings, there has yet to be a person in recorded history who has survived the miasma for longer than a minute without a severe, lasting injury.\n\nThose poor souls unfortunate enough to remain inside a Dead Zone for too long turn into Shriekers - creatures whose minds and bodies have been corrupted by the terrible powers of the miasma. While a Shrieker\u0027s exact form and abilities vary drastically between Dead Zones, all of them possess a blood-curdling scream that paralyzes all but those with a truly indomitable heart. Many Shriekers are also capable of emitting unpredictable waves of destructive energy. A highly agitated Shrieker may suddenly end its own existence in a forceful explosion.\n\nScholars have long speculated upon the true nature of the Dead Zones\u0027 miasma. Some propose that it is the remaining arcane potential of the uncountable number of spellcasters that were annihilated in the war leading up to the Calamity, which has lead too several reckless mages trying to harness the miasma\u0027s power - to no avail. Others claim that the miasma is the remaining energy of the clashing gods - a force defined by nothing but the endless struggle to annihilate itself. While this would certainly explain the chaotic and seemingly self-destructive nature of some of the Shriekers, this theory has yet to be tested by anyone skilled and willing enough to study the Dead Zones.\n\nWhatever the miasma may be, its energy tends to dissipate over the span of centuries, as long as there is enough room for it to become sufficiently diluted. Due to the closed-off nature of the Underdark, it harbours substantially more Dead Zones than the overworld.",
